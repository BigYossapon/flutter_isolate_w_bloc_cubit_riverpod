# Isolate Manager

## **Features**

* An easy way to create multiple isolates for a function, also keep it active to send and receive data multiple times.

* Supports `Worker` on Web (`Worker` is the real Isolate on Web). The plugin will use `Future` (and `Stream`) if `Worker` is unavailable on the working browser or is not configured.

* Multiple `compute`s are allowed because the plugin will queue the input data and sends it to free isolate later.

* Support `try-catch` block.

* If you don't need to control your own function, you can use [isolates_helper](https://pub.dev/packages/isolates_helper) - the simple version of this package that will allow you to compute with multiple functions.

## **Basic Usage** (Use build-in function)

There are multiple ways to use this package, the only thing to notice is that the `function` has to be a `static` or `top-level` function to make it works.

### **Step 1:** Create a top-level or static function

``` dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
double add(List<double> value) => value[0] + value[1];
```

**You have to add `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` anotation to all methods that you want to use for isolation since Flutter 3.3.0. Without this annotation, the dart compiler could strip out unused functions, inline them, shrink names, etc, and the native code would fail to call it.**

### **Step 2:** Create IsolateManager instance for that function

``` dart
final isolateManager = IsolateManager.create(
  add, // Function that you want to compute
  concurrent: 4, // Number of concurrent isolates. Default is 1
);
```

### **Step 3 [Optional]:** Initialize the instance, this step is not required because it's automatically called when you use `.compute` for the first time

``` dart
await isolateManager.start();
```

You can also run this method when creating the instance:

``` dart
final isolateManager = IsolateManager.create(
  add, // Function that you want to compute
  concurrent: 4, // Number of concurrent isolates. Default is 1
)..start();
```

### **Step 4:** Send and receive data

You can listen to the result as `stream`

``` dart
isolateManager.stream.listen((result) => print(result));
```

You can send even more times then `concurrent` because the plugin will queues the input data and sends it to free isolate later.

``` dart
// add([10, 20])
final result = await isolateManager.compute([10, 20]);
```

You can even manage the final result by using this callback, it's useful when you create your own function that needs to send the progress value before returning the final value (look at the example in method `isolateProgressFunction` for more details):

``` dart
final result = await isolateManager.compute([10, 20],
      callback: (value) {
        // Condition to recognize the progress value. Ex:
        final decoded = jsonDecode(value);
        if (decoded.containsKey('progress')) {
          print(decoded['progress']);

          // Mark this value as not the final result
          return false;
        }

        print('The final result is: $value');
        // Mark this value as the final result and send it into the `result`.
        return true;
      }
    )
```

You can use `try-catch` to catch the exception:

``` dart
try {
  final result = await isolateManager.compute([10, 20]);
} on Exception catch (e1) {
  print(e1);
} catch (e2) {
  print(e2);
}
```

Build your widget with `StreamBuilder`

``` dart
StreamBuilder(
  stream: isolateManager.stream,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (!snapshot.hasData) {
      return const Center(
        child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
      );
    }
    return Text('Result of the `add` function: ${snapshot.data}');
  },
),
```

### **Step 5:** Restart the `IsolateManager` if you need it

``` dart
await isolateManager.restart();
```

### **Step 6:** Stop `IsolateManager` when it finishes work

``` dart
await isolateManager.stop();
```

## **Advanced Usage** (Use your own function)

You can control everything with this method when you want to create multiple isolates for a function. With this method, you can also do one-time stuff when the isolate is started or each-time stuff when you call `compute` or `sendMessage`.

### **Step 1:** Create a function of this form

``` dart
/// Create your own function here. This function will be called when your isolate started.
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
void isolateFunction(dynamic params) {
  // Initial the controller for the child isolate. This function will be declared
  // with `double` as the return type (.sendResult) and `List<double>` as the parameter type (.sendMessage).
  final controller = IsolateManagerController<double, List<double>>(
    params, 
    onDispose: () {
      print('Dispose isolateFunction');
    }
  );

  // Get your initialParams.
  // Notice that this `initialParams` different from the `params` above.
  final initialParams = controller.initialParams;

  // Do your one-time stuff here, this area of code will be called only one-time when you `start`
  // this instance of `IsolateManager`

  // Listen to the message receiving from main isolate, this area of code will be called each time
  // you use `compute` or `sendMessage`.
  controller.onIsolateMessage.listen((message) {
    // Create a completer
    Completer completer = Completer();

    // Handle the result an exceptions
    completer.future.then(
      (value) => controller.sendResult(value),
      // Send the exception to your main app
      onError: (err, stack) =>
          controller.sendResultError(IsolateException(err, stack)),
    );

    // Use try-catch to send the exception to the main app
    try {

      // Do your stuff here. 
      completer.complete(add(message[0], message[1]));

    } catch (err, stack) {
      // Send the exception to your main app
      controller.sendResultError(IsolateException(err, stack));
    }
  });
}
```

### **Step 2:** Create IsolateManager instance for your own function

``` dart
final isolateManager = IsolateManager.createOwnIsolate(
    isolateFunction,
    initialParams: 'This is initialParams',
    debugMode: true,
  );
```

### **Step 3:** Now you can use everything as above from this step

## Worker Configuration

* **Step 1:** Download [isolate_manager/worker/worker.dart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vursin/isolate_manager/main/worker/worker.dart) or copy the below code to the file named `worker.dart`:

  <details>
  
  <summary>worker.dart</summary>

  ``` dart
  // ignore_for_file: avoid_web_libraries_in_flutter, depend_on_referenced_packages

  import 'dart:async';
  import 'dart:convert';
  import 'dart:html' as html;
  import 'dart:js' as js;

  import 'package:isolate_manager/isolate_manager.dart';
  import 'package:js/js.dart' as pjs;
  import 'package:js/js_util.dart' as js_util;

  @pjs.JS('self')
  external dynamic get globalScopeSelf;

  /// dart compile js worker.dart -o worker.js -O4

  /// In most cases you don't need to modify this function
  main() {
    callbackToStream('onmessage', (html.MessageEvent e) {
      return js_util.getProperty(e, 'data');
    }).listen((message) async {
      final Completer completer = Completer();
      completer.future.then(
        (value) => jsSendMessage(value),
        onError: (err, stack) => jsSendMessage(IsolateException(err, stack).toJson()),
      );
      try {
        completer.complete(worker(message));
      } catch (err, stack) {
        jsSendMessage(IsolateException(err, stack).toJson());
      }
    });
  }

  /// TODO: Modify your function here:
  ///
  ///  Do this if you need to throw an exception
  ///
  ///  You should only throw the `message` instead of a whole Object because it may
  ///  not show as expected when sending back to the main app.
  ///
  /// ``` dart
  ///  return throw 'This is an error that you need to catch in your main app';
  /// ```
  FutureOr<dynamic> worker(dynamic message) {
    // Best way to use this method is encoding the result to JSON
    // before sending to the main app, then you can decode it back to
    // the return type you want with `workerConverter`.
    return jsonEncode(message);
  }

  /// Internal function
  Stream<T> callbackToStream<J, T>(String name, T Function(J jsValue) unwrapValue) {
    var controller = StreamController<T>.broadcast(sync: true);
    js_util.setProperty(js.context['self'], name, js.allowInterop((J event) {
      controller.add(unwrapValue(event));
    }));
    return controller.stream;
  }

  /// Internal function
  void jsSendMessage(dynamic m) {
    js.context.callMethod('postMessage', [m]);
  }
  ```

  </details>

* **Step 2:** Modify the function `FutureOr<dynamic> worker(dynamic message)` in the script to serves your purposes. You can also use the `top-level or static function` that you have created above.

 **You should copy that function to separated file or copy to `worker.dart` file to prevent the `dart compile js` error because some other functions depend on flutter library.**

* **Step 3:** Run `dart compile js worker.dart -o worker.js -O4` to compile dart to js (-O0 to -O4 is the obfuscated level of `js`).
* **Step 4:** Copy `worker.js` to web folder (the same folder with `index.html`).
* **Step 5:** Now you can add `worker` to `workerName` like below:

  ``` dart
  final isolateManager = IsolateManager.create(
      add,
      workerName: 'worker', // Don't need to add the extension
    );
  ```

  Now the plugin will handle all other action to make the real isolate works on Web.

## Additional

* Use `queuesLength` to get the current number of queued computation.

* Use `ensureStarted` to able to wait for the `start` method to finish when you want to call the `start` method manually without `await` and wait for it later.

* Use `isStarted` to check if the `start` method is completed or not.

* If the `worker.dart` show errors for `js` package, you can add `js` to `dev_dependencies`:
  
  ``` dart
  dev_dependencies:
    js:
  ```

* The result that you get from the isolate (or Worker) is sometimes different from the result that you want to get from the return type in the main app, you can use `converter` and `workerConverter` parameters to convert the result received from the `Isolate` (converter) and `Worker` (workerConverter). Example:

  ``` dart
  final isolateManager = IsolateManager.create(
    convertToMap,
    // Ex: 'map_result' if the name is 'map_result.js'
    workerName: 'worker',
    // Convert the data from worker to fix the issue related to the different data type between dart and js
    workerConverter: (result) {
      final Map<int, double> convert = {};

      // Convert Map<String, String> (received from Worker) to Map<int, double>
      final decodedMap = jsonDecode(result) as Map;
      decodedMap.forEach((key, value) => convert.addAll({int.parse(key): double.parse(value)}));

      return convert;
    },
  );
  ```

  **Data flow:** Main -> Isolate or Worker -> **Converter** -> Result
